Heart attack prediction model using machine learning , models aims to assess the likelihood of a heart attack based on various risk factors like age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, smoking habits, physical activity, and other clinical parameters. Machine learning algorithms analyze patterns in historical patient data and identify features that contribute most to the likelihood of a heart attack, enabling them to make predictions. Among the popular machine learning models used for this purpose are the Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, and XGBoost Classifier. Each of these models has distinct characteristics and advantages that make them suitable for predicting heart attacks.
